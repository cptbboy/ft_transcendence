## Unique Challenges and Accomplishments

Despite having no prior experience in web development, our team rose to the challenge to create this immersive gaming experience. Eschirni, Rsiebert, and Mmeising focused on developing the game, implementing chat and socket connections, while Btenzlin and Tzeck worked on frontend, database, backend API and design. We tried to achieve a terminal-like design by implementing various graphics, a special font, and a unique color scheme.
