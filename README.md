### Unique Challenges and Accomplishments

Despite having no prior experience in web development, our team managed the challenge to create this huge project. Elias, Roman, and Max focused on developing the game, implementing chat and socket connections, while Ben and Tom came up with the design, worked on the database and build our backend API. We tried to achieve a terminal-like design by implementing various graphics, a special font, and a unique color scheme.
